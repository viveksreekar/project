This repository contains a **Personal Expense Tracker** application built with Python's Tkinter for the graphical user interface and SQLite for data storage. It allows users to efficiently manage their daily expenses, track spending, and visualize financial data through interactive graphs.

## Features

  * **Expense Management**: Easily add, view, and delete expense records with details like date, category, amount, and description.
  * **Persistent Storage**: All expense data and user settings (like theme preferences and monthly targets) are securely stored in a local SQLite database.
  * **Theming**: Toggle between light and dark themes for a personalized user experience.
  * **Search Functionality**: Filter expenses by category to quickly find specific transactions.
  * **Bulk Upload**: Import multiple expense records at once from a CSV file.
  * **Interactive Statistics**: Visualize spending patterns with dynamic bar and pie charts, grouped by category, date, or month. Users can also filter these statistics by a custom date range.
  * **Monthly Spending Target**: Set a monthly budget and receive alerts if expenses exceed the target.
